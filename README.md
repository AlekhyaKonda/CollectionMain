Collection Operations in Java
This project provides a generic implementation to perform various operations on Java Collections. It allows users to select the type of data (Integer, Double, Character, 
or String) and the desired collection type (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, etc.). Users can then perform operations such as adding, removing, displaying elements, checking 
size, searching, and clearing the collection. The implementation demonstrates the flexibility of Java Generics and the use of multiple collection frameworks in a user-friendly,
menu-driven program.
